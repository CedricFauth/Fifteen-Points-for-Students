# Fifteen Points for Students
15 Points ist ein Programm, dass wir für (Oberstufen) SchülerInnen entwickelt haben, damit sie ihren Notenschnitt berechnen können.

## Download coming soon!

## General Informations:

__Website:__ https://cedricfauth.github.io/Fifteen-Points-for-Students/

__Requirements:__ The program is the "fifteenPoints.jar"-file and it requires a version of JAVA 8 or higher (I think the most PCs have                      Java today, but you can download it for free on this site: https://java.com/de/download/).

__Platforms:__ Java is available for Win/Linux/Mac and other platforms, but the current version of 15 Points only works on Windows 32bit/64bit.

__Project Members:__ Cedric Fauth and others who don't want to be called.
